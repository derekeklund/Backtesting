Backtesting Framework for Stationary & Co-Integrated Strategies
Overview
This repository is a work in progress for a backtesting framework that:

Tests for stationarity using methods like ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) and KPSS tests.
Performs co-integration analysis to identify pairs or groups of assets that exhibit mean-reverting behavior.
Backtests strategies based on statistical arbitrage and other mean-reversion techniques.
Features (Planned & Implemented)
✔ Perform stationarity tests (ADF).
✔ Identify co-integrated asset pairs.
✔ Implement backtesting engine for pair trading and mean-reversion strategies.
✔ Visualize results with Matplotlib
✔ Optimize parameters using Sharpe ratio and drawdown metrics.
⬜ Build Flask-App to guide users through analyzing potential pairs and backtesting performance
