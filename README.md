# Backtesting Framework for Stationary & Co-Integrated Strategies Overview

This repository is a work in progress for a backtesting framework that:

1. Tests for stationarity using methods like ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)

2. Performs co-integration analysis to identify pairs or groups of assets that exhibit mean-reverting behavior.

3. Backtests strategies based on statistical arbitrage and other mean-reversion techniques.

## Features (Planned & Implemented):

✔ Perform stationarity tests (ADF).

✔ Identify co-integrated asset pairs.

✔ Implement backtesting engine for pair trading and mean-reversion strategies.

✔ Visualize results with Matplotlib

✔ Optimize parameters using Sharpe ratio and drawdown metrics.

⬜ Build Flask-App to guide users through analyzing potential pairs and backtesting performance
